## Messages show in console/chatbot but not stream chat   
You most likely connected the bot to the wrong channel.  
1. Go to connections :bust_in_silhouette: 
2. Go into bot connection (Only available for Twitch)
3. Make sure Streamer Channel is the same as your actual stream name  

## Bot can send messages but isn't responding to commands

Most likely one of the following settings was overlooked.
- `Usage` make sure it's set to the chat that's being used. Stream Whisper means you have to whisper the command
- `Cost` if the cost is set to anything higher than 0 currency must be enabled and user need enough points
- `Cooldown` Broadcaster ignore cooldowns but nobody else does, restarting the bot will clear all cooldowns
- `Permission` & `Info` 

YouTube only - last resort/possible reason.
> Timestamps in the bot doesn't match the timestamps sent from youtube to the bot, so the bot doesn't recognize new messages to respond to. To ensure this isn't the issue simply enable "Set time automatically" and make sure the correct Time zone is selected, how to find these settings is explained [here](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000554.htm). 

## Timers not posting
In order for timers to be working the following events must have occured

- Stream must be live or timers won't post
- The bot must be connected to Streamlabs
- Bot must show `Stream: Online` at the top
- Minimum new chat lines must have been reached
- Interval (min) must have been reached

If the timer still doesn't work it is due to a faulty $parameter inside the timer. Parameters that is a username ($userid, $targetid etc.) or requires an input ($msg, $arg1, $num1 etc.) will cause the time to not show. 


## Songrequest by artist/name
- To enable this feature go into the `Songrequest` tab in the bot then press the :gear: in the top right corner and change `mode` from `$id` to either of the two other options


## Songrequests not responding in chat/Songrequest stuck on track
Songrequests not responding could be a few possible reasons, please check the following reasons first.
1. Songrequests are disabled in the songrequest tab (top left corner)
2. Songrequests have a cost that's higher than the users current currencyamount
3. Songrequests are set to work in discord/whispers only. `settings` :gear: -> `usage` -> `songrequests`

If none of the options above explained your issue you can try resetting songqueue and songrequest settings by following these steps:

1. press the `?` in the bot's top right corner
2. press `open install directory` 
3. close the bot 
4. go into `services` folder 
5. go into `twitch` folder (replace with youtube if you stream there)
6. go into `settings` folder 
7. delete `SongQueue.bin` and `songrequestsettings.bin` 
8. start up the bot
9. enable songrequests


## Songrequests won't play/does not currently recognize any of the video formats available

1. press the `?` in the bot's top right corner
2. press `open install directory` 
3. close the bot 
4. go into `cache` folder
5. delete all content from this folder
6. start up the bot

## SFX aren't playing
> If preview works you can skip these
- Wrong `audio engine` is selected in `settings` :gear: -> `general`
  - 99% of all users should use Wasapi
- File/filepath doesn't exist
- Soundfile format isn't supported (.mp3 only)
- The Chatbot is muted in windows audio mixer

> Preview working but not commands
- `Only play Sound Files when stream is live` is checked in `Commands tab` -> `settings` :gear:
- Sound file commands are on global user cooldown. This setting is in `commands tab` -> `settings` :gear:. Restart the Chatbot to clear cooldowns
- Numbers of votes set is too high, the bot doesn't announce each vote

## Bot crashes/doesn't launch
Streamlabs Chatbot requires some additional files (Visual C++ 2017 Redistributables) that might not be currently installed on your system. Please download and run **both** of these Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 redistributables. **Restart** you computer after installing this.

- [Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable [64bit]](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- [Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable [32bit]](https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

**Both** the 32 bit and 64 bit versions should be installed, even if you have a 64 bit version of Windows


> Running as admin  

- It's always a good option to run the bot as admin to make sure it got all permissions needed. In order to do that you right click your Chatbot Shortcut -> `run as administrator`

> If all else failed it might be MSI afterburner  

- First check if the bot does launch with MSI turned off (If it does not it is a different problem and this solution is not for you) With the bot closed and afterburner open, go into afterburner `settings` -> `User Interface` and make sure `Single tray icon mode` is `OFF`. Then go to your tray, right click `RivaTunerStatisticsServer`, and click `show`.  Click `Add`, then find the Streamlabs `Chatbot.exe`.  Making sure the Streamlabs Chatbot profile is selected, turn Application Detection Level to None.  Open the chatbot and it should work fine now.

## Missing tabs
There are three tabs that can be hidden in the chatbot.
- `Discord tab` is hidden for YouTube since it doesn't support discord integration
- `Scripts tab` is hidden until you connect streamer and bot account under `connections` to the streamer's channel
- `Subscribers tab` is hidden for YouTube

## Scripts not loading
There are no default scripts with the bot currently so in order for them to install they must have been imported manually. 
> Importing scripts
1. Download a .zip file containging the script (preferably from chatbot discord)
2. Go into the scripts tab and press `import` in the top right corner
3. Select the .zip file you downloaded in `step 1`
4. Hit `open` and after a short time it should pop up a message confirming that it was a successful import. 

When troubleshooting scripts your best help is the error view. You can find it in the top right corner of the scripts tab. 
> Troubleshooting scripts
- No module named `os` / `json`
  - Make sure [python 2.7.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/)  x86 is installed. Don't use newer versions of python or x64
  - Make sure the lib folder path found in `scripts tab` -> `settings` :gear: leads to the lib folder located inside the python folder that was created when installing python. By default this would look like [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/5mtHoNL.png)  
- Unexpected token `from` / `:`
  - Make sure you installed [python 2.7.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/) x86 and NOT python 3.X

If minigames still aren't working make sure that `settings` :gear: -> `usage` -> `minigames` are set to match where you try to use them. Minigames can only be either discord or stream chat and not both.

## Bot size is huge/tiny on one or multiple monitors
right click the chatbot shortcut -> go to the `compability tab` -> change `scaling option` to system "Override high DPI scaling behavior. Scaling performed by:" -> select `system`.
If your shortcut is in the task bar you have to `right click` the icon -> `right click` where it says "Streamlabs Chatbot" and then you go to the compability tab. [Example](https://i.gyazo.com/e445bedb5389fee195c6137448866a43.gif)  

## Tab names are unreadable
This is an interference caused by Sonic Radar by ASUR or A-Volute. To resolve the issue, uninstall Sonic Radar and restart your PC


## Notifications aren't working
Click the :bust_in_silhouette: in the bottom left corner of the bot and go to `streamlabs` 
1. Disconnect from streamlabs
2. Generate token (make sure it's using the streamer account)
3. Connect to streamlabs  

> Note that you also need to have any widget open. Alert box/event list/ chat box/streamlabels/ Streamlabs OBS

## Can't update game/tile through dashboard or command

Your twitch token for the streamer account expired. Please generate a new one
`connections` :bust_in_silhouette: -> `twitch streamer` -> `disconnect` -> `generate token` -> `connect`

## Can't complete the captcha in the setup wizard
This only happens during the first time you launch the bot so you just need to get it through the wizard once to be able to use the bot. 
Generally speaking there are 3 ways to do this.

1. Follow  the steps below to set up a shortcut to skip the setup wizard.  
   - Make sure to close the Chatbot completely.  
   - Right click on the Streamlabs Chatbot shortcut (if you don't have one please create one)  
   - Select `properties`  
   - Place your cursor at the very end of the `target` input box  
   - Add a space right behind the "  
   - Type in `twitch` behind the space, if done correctly it should look like [this](http://prntscr.com/kgnb4f)
   - Hit `Apply` and try to launch the bot, the setup wizard should now be skipped.  
   - In order to connect the bot please press the :bust_in_silhouette: in the bottom left corner and use the links below to generate tokens in your browser.

2. Using a VPN, we only recommend trying this if you got experience with using a VPN.

3. Please make sure you have tried #1 carefully and as last possible option visit the [discord](https://www.discord.gg/stream) and ask any support member for help.  

## Can't generate token  

This is due to a connection issue between the bot and the site it needs to generate the token. 
- Make sure there's an expcetion for the bot in your firewall
- Make sure there's an exception for the bot in your antivirus/windows defender
- Disabling ipv6 have resolved the issue for some users [Guide Here](https://support.streamlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004232954-How-to-solve-IPv6-issues) 

If nothing else work you can manually generate some tokens through these links
